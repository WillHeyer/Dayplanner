# Dayplanner

A calendar app that lets the user schedule for each hour of the current day.

# Overview
Based on the Acceptance Criteria, I was able to create a calendar that will allow the user to schedule for each hour of the current day.

# Features 

These include being able to see today's day, time blocks that run from 9AM to 5PM showing whether each time block is in the past, present, or future tense. Users can enter a calendar event to rememeber. Users can click the save button on the right of that time block. If the user closes the page, upon they can also see what they previously saved.
